# MVA G
Project realised for the MVA course "Geometric Data Analysis" supervised by Jean Feydy. Project is based on [**"Fake News Detection on Social Media using Geometric Deep Learning"**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.06673.pdf). 

## Report
Report with our contributions to find [here]([https://github.com/RomanPlaud/RecVisProject/blob/master/report.pdf](https://github.com/RomanPlaud/Geometric-Project/blob/main/geometric_project.pdf).

## Contributions
Our work focus on implementing the proposed architecture on a new dataset. We also implement a new framework in which classification is performed using solely the graph structure of the tweet propagation. See the [report](https://github.com/RomanPlaud/Geometric-Project/blob/main/geometric_project.pdf) for futher details 

## Code
Our implementation partly relies on [https://github.com/YingtongDou/GCNN](https://github.com/YingtongDou/GCNN)
